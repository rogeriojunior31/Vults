Zeca and the vults are black vultures (*Coragyps atratus*). Every clip is built from something a
real black vulture does, so the bird reads as a vulture before it reads as a status light.

## What a black vulture looks like

- Matte black plumage with a faint blue sheen; a short, square tail.
- A bare, wrinkled, dark gray head on a short neck; a slender bill with a pale, hooked tip.
- Pale gray legs.
- In flight, broad short wings whose primaries are silvery-white underneath, splayed like fingers.

## How it moves

| Behavior | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| Flapping flight | Three or four quick, shallow, stiff beats, then a short glide on flat wings (no "V", unlike the turkey vulture) |
| Soaring | Wide circles in a thermal, gliding, drifting upward |
| Take-off | A crouch and a hop, then deep, heavy downstrokes |
| Landing | Wings up and forward to brake, feet out, wings folded only after touching down |
| Perched | Hunched shoulders, head forward; it turns its head to watch and tilts it to inspect |
| Sunning | Wings spread wide, facing the sun |
| Threat | Feathers raised, a hiss with the bill open |
| Sleep | Fluffed up, head sunk into the shoulders |

## Clips

| Clip | Activity or state | Behavior it borrows |
|---|---|---|
| `idle` | idle | Watching, blinking, a look back over the shoulder |
| `think` | think | Head drawn up and still, slow blinks |
| `read` | read | Head down, scanning along a line and dropping to the next |
| `search` | search | Neck out, quick head turns, a tilt to look closer |
| `edit` | edit | The feeding motion: lean in, strike, tear back |
| `run` | run | Quick tugs at the wire, feet shuffling for grip |
| `approval` | approval | Sunning pose, facing you, head bobbing |
| `question` | question | The curious head tilt, held |
| `done` | done | A wing stretch, a hop, settle |
| `fail` | fail | Feathers up, a hiss, a shake |
| `sleep` | sleep | Fluffed up, head tucked |
| `swallow` | a file dropped on him | Down to the wire, pick it up, toss the head back and gulp |
| `gape` | a file dragged over the island | Head up, bill open, waiting for it to drop in |
| `fly` | web | A full sortie: take off, flap-flap-flap-glide out, glide home, flare, land, turn |

The `idle` clip includes a preening bout (head into the wing, quick nibbles), and `done` ends with
one wing raised over the back in a stretch.

## The flock on the wire

- Zeca stands for the session that needs you, or the most recent one; every other session is a vult.
- A new session's vult glides in from the right and lands; a finished one takes off and flies away.
- A bird idle for 90 seconds fluffs up and dozes.
- The agent shows as a small band at the base of the neck (Claude orange, Codex teal), never as the
  bird's color.
- A clip plays at least 600 ms before a calmer one replaces it; approval, question and failure cut in
  at once. A flight always lands before the next clip starts.

## Where the art lives

- `design/mascots/zeca/zeca.py` is the source: palette, parts (body, head poses, flight frames) and
  clips. Run it after a change; it writes `ui/src/character/zeca/zeca.json` and the review sheet
  `design/mascots/zeca/clips.png`.
- A frame stacks parts at integer offsets, so a head pose or a blink is drawn once and reused.
- `ui/src/character/sprites.ts` draws frames and picks one by time; it knows nothing about vultures.
- The lab (`npm run dev`, then `/lab/`) loops every clip and flies a full sortie: take-off, flapping
  cruise, a thermal, a glide home, the landing.
